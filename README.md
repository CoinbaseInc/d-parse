# D★Parse

_D★Parse_ is a parser combinator library for Ruby.

**STATUS**: Experimental. Pre-alpha. Use at your own risk.

## Example

Here is a parser for a series of numbers:

```ruby
require 'd-parse'
include DParse::DSL

digit =
  char_in('0'..'9')

parser =
  seq(
    intersperse(
      repeat(digit).capture.map { |d| d.to_i(10) },
      char(',').ignore,
    ).compact,
    eof,
  ).first

res = parser.apply("1,2,100,582048,07,09")
case res
when DParse::Success
  p res.data
when DParse::Failure
  $stderr.puts res.pretty_message
  exit 1
end
```

## Parsers

* `alt(p1, p2, …)` attempts to apply any of the given parsers

* `any` parses any character

* `char_in(cs)` parses a character that is in the `cs` collection

* `char_not_in(cs)` parses a character that is not in the `cs` collection

* `char_not(c)` parses a character that is not `c`

* `char(c)` parses the single character `c`

* `eof` parses the end of file

* `fail` always fails

* `rename_failure(p, message)` sets the failure message of the parsing result of `p`, if it fails, to `message`

* `repeat(p)` tries to apply `p` as many times as possible, and never fails

* `seq(p1, p2, …)` tries to apply the given parsers in sequence

* `succeed` always succeeds, without advancing the position

Special modifiers:

* `lazy { p }`

* `p.capture` sets the data of the parsing result of `p`, if successful, to the data between the start and the end of the match.

* `p.ignore` sets the data of the parsing result of `p`, if successful, to `nil`

* `p.map`

## To do

As mentioned above, this software is in an early state, and still lacks many features. It is not yet a fully functional parser combinator library, but it’ll hopefully get there.

* Add more combinators (e.g. `repeat1`).

* Add support for backtracking, so that `seq(repeat(any), string('donkey'))` can parse `superdonkey`.

* Add failure descriptions to all parsers.

* Allow renaming failures, so that errors can be easier to understand for hoominz.

* Add tests for everything.

* Add documentation.

## Commit message conventions

As an experiment, I’m going to use commit message conventions slightly adapted from [Angular.js](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)’s.

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
```

The following types are supported:

* `feat` (new feature)
* `fix` (bug fix)
* `docs` (documentation)
* `style` (formatting, …)
* `refactor`
* `test` (adding tests)
* `chore` (maintenance, such as build infrastructure changes)

The following scopes are supported:

* `core`
* `parsers`
* `samples`

The following rules apply to the subject:

* Use the imperative, present tense.
* Do not capitalize the first letter.
* Do not end the subject with a period.
